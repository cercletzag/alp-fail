The file you want to edit is the [README.md](https://github.com/terencehuynh/alp-fail/edit/master/README.md).

If you're looking to add something to the website itself, continue reading below.

The website is built using:

- [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)
- [Fannypack](https://fannypack.style), which also includes:
  - [Reakit](https://reakit.io)

Fork, then clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:your-username/alp-fail.git
```

Install all the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then, run this command so you can make changes and see them when saving:

```

After making your changes, push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].
